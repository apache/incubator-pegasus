 * Description:
 *     this file define the C Service API in rDSN
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  The service system call API for Zion
 * -------------------------------------------
 *  Summary:
 *  (1) rich API for common distributed system development
 *      - thread pools and tasking
 *      - thread synchronization
 *      - remote procedure calls
 *      - asynchnous file operations
 *      - envrionment inputs
 *      - rDSN app model, system and other utilities
 *  (2) portable
 *      - compilable on many platforms (currently linux, windows, FreeBSD, MacOS)
 *      - system calls are in C so that later language wrappers are possibles.
 *  (3) high performance
 *      - all low level components can be plugged with the tool API (in C++)
 *        besides the existing high performance providers;
 *      - developers can also configure thread pools, thread numbers, thread/task
 *        priorities, CPU core affinities, throttling policies etc. declaratively
 *        to build a best threading model for upper apps.
 *  (4) ease of intergration
 *      - support many languages through language wrappers based on this c interface
 *      - easy support for existing protocols (thrift/protobuf etc.)
 *      - integrate with existing platform infra with low level providers (plug-in),
 *        such as loggers, performance counters, etc.
 *  (5) rich debug, development tools and runtime policies support
 *      - tool API with task granularity semantic for further tool and runtime policy development.
 *      - rich existing tools, tracer, profiler, simulator, model checker, replayer, global checker
 *  (7) PRINCIPLE: all non-determinims must be go through these system calls so that powerful
 *      internal tools are possible - replay, model checking, replication, ...,
 *      AND, it is still OK to call other DETERMINISTIC APIs for applications.
