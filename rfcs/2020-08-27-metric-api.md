# Metric API

## Summary

This RFC proposes a new metric API in replace of the old perf-counter API.

## Motivation

The perf-counter API has bad naming convention to be parsed and queried over the external monitoring system like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), or [open-falcon](http://open-falcon.org/).

Here are some examples of the perf-counter it exposes:

- `replica*eon.nfs_client*recent_copy_data_size`
- `zion*profiler*RPC_RRDB_RRDB_MULTI_GET.latency.server.p999`
- `collector*app.pegasus*app.stat.put_qps#xiaomi_algo_browser`
- `replica*app.pegasus*check_and_mutate_qps@15.34`

Apart from the perf-counter name, there are 3 "tags" for each counter: 

```
replica*eon.nfs_client*recent_copy_data_size | service=pegasus, job=replica, port=35801
```

From our experiences, this naming rules have the problems listed below:

- The name includes invalid characters for Prometheus: '*', '.', '@', '#'. While they are legal in open-falcon, in order to support Prometheus we must convert all these characters to '_'. It causes that Pegasus has to expose different styles of counter name to the two monitoring systems.

- Strange and meaningless words like "zion", "eon" are included in the counter name. 

- Information like "table name", "replica id" are weirdly encoded into the counter name following some obsecure rules, such as "`#<table name>`" and "`@<replica id>`". This increases the difficulty on the engineering of perf-counters, that needs additional parsing.

## Design

### Naming

Firstly, let's take a look on the new naming. For the above perf-counters:

- `​nfs_client_recent_copy_data_size | entity=server`
- `​RPC_RRDB_RRDB_MULTI_GET_server_latency | ​p=999,entity=server`
- `​put_qps | table=xiaomi_algo_browser,entity=table`
- `​check_and_mutate_qps | table=13,partition=34,entity=replica`

What's changed:

- I apply [the naming rules of prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels), only use underscores '_' for word separator.

- Better utilization of "tags"/"labels" (optional key-value pairs for attributes of each metric).
  - "`#<table name>`" is replaced with tag "`table=<table name>`"
  - "`@<replica id>`" is replaced with tags "`table=<table id>,partition=<partition id>`".

- I introduce a new tag called "entity", which is used to identify the level of the perf-counter. There are 3 types of entity in Pegasus:
  - entity=server
  - entity=table
  - entity=replica

### API

As the naming is changed now, the perf-counter API must be correspondingly evolved. That is the new metric API.

To declare a perf-counter, take `get_qps` of a replica as an example, what was it like:

```cpp
class rocksdb_store {
private:
  perf_counter_wrapper _get_qps;
};

rocksdb_store::rocksdb_store() {
  _get_qps = init_app_counter(
        "app.pegasus",
        fmt::format("get_qps@{}", str_gpid),
        COUNTER_TYPE_RATE,
        "statistic the qps of GET request");
}
```

After using the new API:

```cpp
​METRIC_DEFINE_meter(server, get_qps, kRequestsPerSecond, "the qps of GET requests")

METRIC_DEFINE_entity(replica);

class rocksdb_store {
private:
    meter_ptr _get_qps;
};

rocksdb_store::rocksdb_store() {
  _replica_entity = METRIC_ENTITY_replica.instantiate(str_gpid, {
      { "table" : get_gpid().app_id() },
      { "partition" : get_gpid().partition_index() },
  });

  _get_qps = ​METRIC_get_qps.instantiate(replica_entity);
}
```

The code might be seemingly more complicated, but in fact it's simpler:

1. Each instance of `METRIC_ENTITY_replica` is attributed with a replica's ID. Instantiated once, the instance (`_replica_entity`) can be used to create every metric belongs to this replica, compared to old API, where every perf-counter needs to encode ID into its name (`fmt::format("get_qps@{}", str_gpid)`).

2. "app.pegasus" in the old API is called a "section". We now use entity instead. Remembering what a section name means is not friendly to new-comers.

3. Metric definition and metric instantiation is decoupled. A metric is defined in global scope, its instantiation in the constructor of `rocksdb_store` is reduced to one line of code.

The API is inspired by [kudu metrics](https://github.com/apache/kudu/blob/master/src/kudu/util/metrics.h), which is a well-documented and mature implementation of metrics in C++.

## Notes

The documentations and monitoring templates must adapt to the latest metric name when this refactoring is released.
