# Pegasus Docker

This project maintains the stuff you can use from building Pegasus docker images,
to deploying a standalone cluster of Pegasus containers on your local machine.

## Workflows

[![BuildCompilationEnvDocker - build and publish multi compilation OS env](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pegasus/actions/workflows/build-push-env-docker.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pegasus/actions/workflows/build-push-env-docker.yml)

[![BuildThirdpartyDockerRegularly - build and publish thirdparty every week](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pegasus/actions/workflows/thirdparty-regular-push.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pegasus/actions/workflows/thirdparty-regular-push.yml)

## pegasus-build-env

Building environment for Pegasus compilation.

Github Actions automatically rebuilds and publishes build-env for every commit.

- `apache/pegasus:build-env-centos7`
- `apache/pegasus:build-env-ubuntu1604`
- `apache/pegasus:build-env-ubuntu1804`
- `apache/pegasus:build-env-ubuntu2004`

DockerHub: https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/pegasus

The How-to-use Manual is at: http://pegasus.apache.org/docs/build/compile-by-docker/

## thirdparties-src

This image is to eliminate extra downloading of third-party sources of Pegasus.
It packages the downloaded sources into a zip in the container, so that
other repos can easily extract third-parties from the container (via `docker cp`),
without downloading from the cloud object storage.

- `apache/pegasus:thirdparties-src-<branch>`

## thirdparties-bin

This is a Docker image for Pegasus unit-testing. It prebuilts the thirdparty libraries,
so jobs based on this image can skip building third-parties.

- `apache/pegasus:thirdparties-bin-centos7-master`
- `apache/pegasus:thirdparties-bin-ubuntu1604-master`
- `apache/pegasus:thirdparties-bin-ubuntu1804-master`
- `apache/pegasus:thirdparties-bin-ubuntu2004-master`
